# Project 1 — EDA on Retail Sales Data

This project is part of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship**.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

## 📌 Key Steps
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (no missing or duplicate values).
- Performed descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
- Analyzed sales by product category, customer demographics, and weekdays.
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain product categories contribute a major portion of total sales.
- Clear trends can be seen across age groups and weekdays.
- Peak month and customer segments identified for potential marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
